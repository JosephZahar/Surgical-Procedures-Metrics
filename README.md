# Surgical Procedures Metrics
This dashboard offers a comprehensive view designed to compare and analyze various definitions of surgical procedure durations. Its primary objective is to standardize and clarify the different time metrics used in surgical practices, ensuring a consistent understanding that can lead to enhanced patient care. The dashboard comprises three sections: a composition page, a comparative page, and a distribution page. These sections delve into analyzing each definition by hospital and surgeon.
